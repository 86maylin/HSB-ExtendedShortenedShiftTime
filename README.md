# ONLY WORKS IN CAREER MODE
Do you ever want to work overtime for your shifts? Or maybe get off work early? I've got the special tool you need right here. Lynx won't pay extra for the overtime of course, and thanks to your fellow ship-breakers covering up for you, you can mostly slip away early without getting noticed.

Default changes the shift duration to 20 minutes.
You can either use the slider at the bottom of ship select screen, or open the config located under BepInEx\config\86maylin.extend_shorten_shift_time.cfg (generated after installing mod and running the game at least once) to specify/fine-tune the settings you want.

Install instruction:
- Unzip [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.22) 64 bit (x64) version into game folder
- Unzip this mod into game folder(zip file has correct folder structure already, ExtendShortenShiftTime.dll should go under BepInEx\plugins\ExtendShortenShiftTime)
- Run and close the game once so BepInEx can initialize
